# 🤖 Simple React Chatbot

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Simple Chatbot** built using **React.js** as part of my learning and practice journey with the React framework.  
It demonstrates how to manage user input, handle state, and implement basic chatbot logic using JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Practice **React fundamentals**
- Understand **component-based architecture**
- Work with **state and user events**
- Apply simple logic in an interactive application

## ⚙️ Features
The chatbot can respond to basic user commands such as:
- 📅 Displaying the **current date**
- 🪙 **Flipping a coin** (Heads or Tails)
- 🎲 **Rolling a dice** (random number between 1 and 6)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🚀 How the Chatbot Works
1. The user types a message into the chat input.
2. The chatbot analyzes the message.
3. Based on predefined keywords, it generates a response.
4. The response is displayed instantly in the chat interface.

## 📂 Project Structure
- Reusable React components for UI
- State management to store messages
- Conditional logic to determine chatbot responses
